### Description

This is a Weather Dashboard built using OpenWeather API. The application shows today's weather and a 5 days forecast. For the 5 days forecast I made an extra AJAX call. The application also displays an icon representation of the actual weather. When the app is seen in a small screen I choose to not display the recent searches to provide a better user experience. This feature is available only in large screens. When you first land in the page only the search field and button are displayed and after you hit submit the information is displayed in the screen .
Future fixings : Addinf the Geolocation API.
